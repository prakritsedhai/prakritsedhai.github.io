If you're a programmer, you probably spend a good part of your day searching Google for solutions to bugs, syntax reminders, or obscure documentation. While Google is already powerful, a few search tricks can make it even better for coders.

Inspired by [Lifehack](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html) and [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/google-search-tips-youll-want-to-learn), here’s a list of useful Google search tips tailored for coding and computer science enthusiasts.

#### Handy Google Search Tricks for Coders

- **Search Within a Specific Site**

  Find results only from Stack Overflow:

  `site:stackoverflow.com Python list comprehension`

- **Search for File Types**

  Discover Python cheat sheets in PDF format:

  `python cheat sheet filetype:pdf`

- **Use Quotes for Exact Matches**

  Look for an exact error message:

  `"TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'"`

- **Exclude Words**

  Exclude Java when searching for 'Python tutorials':

  `python tutorials -java`

- **Wildcard Searches**

  Use `*` as a wildcard placeholder:

  `"how to * in Python"`

- **OR Operator**

  Find results for either C++ or Java tutorials:

  `C++ tutorials OR Java tutorials`

- **Search by Time Range**

  Discover recent AI frameworks from the past year:

  `AI frameworks after:2024-01-01`

- **Use Related Sites**

  Find sites similar to GitHub:

  `related:github.com`

- **Convert Units or Currency**

  Google can convert programming time estimates too:

  `3 hours to minutes`

- **Check Definitions Quickly**

  Instantly look up definitions of CS terms:

  `define:encapsulation`
