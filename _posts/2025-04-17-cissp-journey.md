## Introduction

Getting the **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)** certification had been on my list for a long time. I bought the study guide nearly two years ago, but like many, I kept pushing it off because I hadn't booked an exam date. Finally, I decided to stop procrastinating and booked my exam for **December 31, 2025**. From that moment, I started preparing seriously.

In this blog post, Iâ€™ll share the resources I used, how I structured my preparation, and some insights from my exam experience.

## Resources I Used

I took a blended approach to studying â€” using videos, mind maps, practice questions, and books. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what helped me most:

1. [Prabh Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArK-_sBBlCfhaGFF_3CASSoX1HQhmkVx0o) - _Coffee Shots_: Daily short videos that cover CISSP concepts concisely. You can check them out [here](https://lnkd.in/gB9xwSng). Highly recommended for quick revision.

2. [Destination Certification Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/destination-certification/) - I followed their mind map videos on YouTube and downloaded the domain summaries from their website. The visual approach made it easy to connect topics.

3. [Professor Messer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/professormesser/) - Fantastic resource for clarifying network security concepts. His videos are clear and well-organized.

4. [Luke Ahmed ðŸš€](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACCowTYBGhm3wXYCO2YL4lcTk1-3e6p2OwI) - His strategy on _how to think like a manager_ is something every CISSP aspirant should follow. The exam tests managerial decision-making, not just technical knowledge.

5. **Practice Questions**:

   - I used **Quantum Exams** extensively.
   - The **Sybex Official Study Guide** practice questions were also a key part of my prep.

6. **Andrew Ramdayal** - His _50 CISSP Practice Questions_ on YouTube were great for getting a feel of exam scenarios.

## How I Studied

Iâ€™ve been working in **cybersecurity for almost 6 years**, so many of the concepts were already familiar to me. That definitely helped in grasping advanced topics quickly.

I created notes combining key points from all the resources listed above. Iâ€™d watch a video or read a chapter summary and immediately jot down essential ideas.

For note-taking, I used **Obsidian** â€” a markdown-based note-taking app â€” and backed up my notes on **GitHub**. This allowed me to review them from anywhere and keep them organized by domain.

## Exam Experience

I passed the CISSP exam in **100 questions**, with almost **1 hour left on the clock**. The exam was challenging, and it truly tests your ability to **think like a manager** rather than focusing solely on technical details.

## Final Thoughts

If youâ€™re preparing for the CISSP, my advice would be:

- **Book the exam date first**. It creates accountability.
- Use a mix of video, mind maps, and practice questions.
- Focus on understanding the _why_ behind every decision.
- Take consistent notes and revise them regularly.

If youâ€™re a note-taking fan like me, give **Obsidian + GitHub** a try â€” it made my prep much smoother.
